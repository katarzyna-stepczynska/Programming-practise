# Build Fullstack MERN Application
## Practise coding with JavaScript Mastery

###### Introduction:
Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB to build a Full Stack MERN Project - from start to finish. The App is called "Happy memories" and it is a simple social media MERN application that allows users to post interesting events and beautiful places that happened in their lives. In this project I used Japanese places as sample posts.

###### Libraries used:
Backend (server):
* express
* nodemon
* body-parser
* cors
* mongodb
* mongoose
* bcrypt
* jsonwebtoken

Frontend (client):
* axios
* moment
* react-file-base64
* redux
* redux-thunk
* react-redux
* react-router-dom
* @mui-material
* @mui/icons-material
* jwt-decode
* @react-oauth/google
* downshift



###### Status:
Project is: **DONE**

In future:
- [ ] work with Material UI to refactor style and deploy
- [ ] logging with Google account (OAuth) works correctly, but cannot add posts, comment or like - functionalities with Google account after logging would be improved

###### Use:
1. Go to folder 'server', in terminal run `npm i` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
3. Go to folder 'client', in terminal run `npm i` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` for a react script start. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
